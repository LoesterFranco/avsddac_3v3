# Potentiometric-DAC
This repository contains a 10-bit potentiometric digital to analog converter. Here it is tried to achieve the specifications by vsd corporation pvt. ltd.
The design has been built using open-source EDA tools. For prelayout simulaions, eeschema, ngspice and kicad are used from esim. The library used is osu180nm library.

## Digital-to-Analog Converter
These building blocks are required to convert digital data into analog.

## About IP
The target is to design 10-bit potentiometric DAC with 3.3v analog voltage and 1 off-chip external reference using osu180nm tech node.

# Open-Source EDA tools
Here I have used esim on windows operating system, which contains eeschema for building circuits,
