## 1. Introduction to Potentiometric Digital to Analog Converter
This repository presents a 10-bit Potentiometric Digital to Analog Converter. The target is to design 10-bit potentiometric DAC with 3.3v analog voltage and 1 off-chip external reference using osu180nm technology node. Here are the specifications taken from [VSD Corporation Pvt. Ltd.](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/ip/)
The DAC is a building block required to convert digital data into analog.

## 2.EDA Tools Used 
The design has been built using open-source EDA tools. The library used is osu180nm. 
I have used [eSim](https://esim.fossee.in/downloads) to build schematic, ngSpice and LtSpice to run simulations and verify the circuit. [Magic]() has been used to lay-out the circuit.

## 5. Post-layout Simulations



| Parameter| Pre-layout (LSB)| 
| :---:  | :-: |
|DNL| -0.999893345 LSB to 2.03065020 LSB|
|INL| 0.527216491 LSB to -1.953038429 LSB|

## 6. Instructions to get started with the design
For Pre-Layout Simulation - 
 1. Download eSim from the given [website](https://esim.fossee.in/downloads).
 2. Download this repository.
 3. Keep the contents of [subcircuits folder](https://github.com/xzlashutosh/potentiometric-DAC/tree/master/subcircuits) inside the eSim subcircuits folder (C:\FOSSEE\eSim\library\SubcircuitLibrary).
 4. Store the [libary files](https://github.com/xzlashutosh/potentiometric-DAC/tree/master/Libraries/User%20Libraries) in the eSim User Library section (C:\FOSSEE\eSim\library\deviceModelLibrary\User Libraries).
 5. Download and open the 10_bit_dac project in eSim kept in Ciruits and Simulations [folder](https://github.com/xzlashutosh/potentiometric-DAC/tree/master/Circuits%20and%20Simulations/10_bit_dac).
 6. Run the schematic, convert to ngspice and simulate the design to view the output. You should get the output as shown above in the figure.
    The simulation may take more than an hour to complete. Kindly keep patience.

 For Post-Layout Simulation - 
 1. Download Magic from the given [website]() for Linux and Mac. For windows you will have to install Cygwin Terminal and then Magic can run on windows platform. 
 2. Download this repository.
 3. Store the [libary files](https://github.com/xzlashutosh/potentiometric-DAC/tree/master/Libraries/User%20Libraries) in the same folder.
 4. Go to the specific directory to run the Magic file.
 5. To open the 10BitDac.mag with osu180nm.tech using terminal type - 
        magic -T osu180nm.tech 10BitDac
 6. To extract the spice netlist type in TkCon window -
        extract all
        ext2spice 10BitDac.ext
 7. To simulate the layout run ngspice in another terminal using -
        ngspice 10BitDac.spice
