# Potentiometric-DAC
This repository contains a 10-bit potentiometric digital to analog converter. Here it is tried to achieve the specifications by vsd corporation pvt. ltd.
The design has been built using open-source EDA tools. For prelayout simulaions, eeschema, ngspice and kicad are used from esim. The library used is osu180nm library.

## Digital-to-Analog Converter
These building blocks are required to convert digital data into analog.

## About IP
The target is to design 10-bit potentiometric DAC with 3.3v analog voltage and 1 off-chip external reference using osu180nm tech node.

# Open-Source EDA tools used to design the IP
Here I have used esim on windows operating system, which contains eeschema for building schematics of the circuits, and then to convert we have ngspice.
The subcircuit funnction available in eSim have been used extensively in this project.

## Steps to install eSim
Go to https://esim.fossee.in/downloads and download for windows
